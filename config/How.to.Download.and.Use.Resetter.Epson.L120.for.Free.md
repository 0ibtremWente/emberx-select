## What is Resetter Epson L120?
 
Resetter Epson L120 is a software program that can reset the ink pad counter and clear the red light error on your Epson L120 printer. This error occurs when the printer detects that the ink pads are at the end of their service life and need to be replaced. However, replacing the ink pads can be costly and time-consuming, so some users prefer to use a resetter tool instead. This tool can reset the printer's memory and allow it to print normally again.
 
However, using a resetter tool is not recommended by the printer manufacturer, as it may affect the performance and quality of your printer. It is also not a permanent solution, as the ink pads will eventually overflow and cause damage to your printer. Therefore, you should only use a resetter tool as a last resort and at your own risk.
